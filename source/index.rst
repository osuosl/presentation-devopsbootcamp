There be dragons!

Theory vs. Applied
------------------

    :align: center
    :scale: 40%

.. note:: Emily & discuss own experience with how OSU teaches CS

- More focus on theory than applied

  - Classwork rarely mimics real-world
  - Difficult to apply theory

Student Jobs
------------

    :align: right 
    :scale: 50%

.. note:: Emily
    Also, more students TA than get to work at OSL/Helpdesk/BSG... this does
    *not* teach good software development, or any sysadminning

.. note:: photo by Judy Baxter, https://www.flickr.com/photos/judybaxter/14999803/

*Finding experience on campus*

- Limited roles and access
- Limited availability
- No structure

Insufficient Mentoring
----------------------

.. figure:: _static/osl-noc2.jpg
  :align: center
  :scale: 55%

.. note:: Lance

- No dedicated staff/faculty
- LUG's help, but not the solution 
- No centralized program

  - Need a place for advanced students to excel more
  - Also need an environment for *"newbies"*
- Limited qualified staff with time to mentor

OSL Student Experience
======================

Giving students real-world experience and mentorship

.. figure:: _static/osuosl-logo-round.png
  :align: center

OSL Overview
------------

.. note:: Lance

- Provide hosting for FOSS projects
- Services we provide

  - Co/Location
  - Virtualization (Cloud)
  - Managed/Unmanaged hosting
  - Email, DNS, mailing list, etc
- Development focused on supporting hosting
- Media communications team

OSL NOC
-------

OSL Student Experience
----------------------

.. note:: Emily on own experience with how it's awesome

- Given full *"root"*
- Spend six months mentoring

  - Mix of full-timer and senior student mentorships
- Work on support tickets and customers
- Interact with people internationally
- Ownership of a project
- Treated like a full-timer

Scaling problem
---------------

.. note:: Lance

.. rst-class:: build

- Balancing FTE to Student ratios
- A lot of time and resource is put in mentoring
- OSL Students represent less than 1% of OSU CS population
- Budget constraints on hiring more students
- Only so much work to be done

DevOps Bootcamp
===============

.. note:: picture of something on this slide, and speaker notes on topic
    transition

Expanding DevOps beyond the OSL...

http://devopsbootcamp.osuosl.org

Portland State *"Braindump"*
----------------------------

.. note:: Lance

- Weekly meet up to teach being sysadmin
- In-depth teaching on specific topics (DNS, Apache, etc)
- Graduated system

  - Start out with helpdesk support
  - Get "non-root" access to systems
  - "Rooter"
- Year long program

  - Starts out with 60+ end up with ~10 solid recruits

http://braindump.cat.pdx.edu

Free Online Classes
-------------------

.. note:: Emily

- Designed to be completely self-directed
- Need lots of time and specific learning style

- OpsSchool

   - Tends to be sysadmin-focused
   - Very old-school
   - Ops equivalent of CS MOOCs
- MIT OpenCourseWare
- Coursera
- edx.org

Learning from breaking
----------------------

.. note:: Emily:

  Yes most of us are self-taught but I've noticed that things I've learned from
  others via mentorship are much easier to teach in person. Also, on the
  diversity note, having a *safe* place to play is extremely important because
  when someone's dealing with the issues that plague minorities in tech
  (tokenism, impostor syndrome, etc.) there are a lot more factors telling you
  "no don't risk breaking that, even if you might learn something" than there
  would be for a non-minority.

- How did we learn these skills ourselves?

  - Self learning!
  - Support community (LUG, friends, mentors, etc)
- Access to a production-like environments ``==`` safe place to *play*
- Preconfigured by us, but then modified by them
- Introduce troubleshooting via breakage

Feedback
--------

.. note:: Lance

- Attendance

  - First meeting: 34 | Other meetings: 10-20
- Format seems to work
- Vagrant and Virtualbox can be a PITA
- Recording using Google Hangouts is great *(but buggy)*
- Having everything in git is awesome
- It takes a long time to make content
- We didn't cover everything we wanted
- Learn to be flexible
- K.I.S.S. (Keep It Simple Stupid)

Making your own DOBC
--------------------

.. note:: Emily

- This sounds great, you want to start something like this?
- DO IT!

  - Even if you're not sure.
  - Even if you don't know all the things yet.
  - You'll learn fast.
- Resources are everywhere

  - Anyone who says they think it's cool
- Offer bite-sized ways to contribute

  - Speak for 15 minutes on your specialty?
  - vs. be on a curriculum committee forever

Lessons Learned
---------------

- Time management

    - You're a sysadmin; automate yourself out of a job
    - Calendar reminders for recurring tasks
    - You wouldn't rewrite the same code; planning and bureaucratic overhead
      are also reusable
- Skills can be taught; enthusiasm can't.

Next Steps
==========

.. note:: Lance. Add picture

Building a mock infrastructure
------------------------------

- Build a breakable infrastructure

  - Best to learn from real-world experience
  - But not production (yet)
- Basic services:

  - DNS, Email, web, database, etc
- Develop a basic webapp collaboratively
- Utilize configuration management (puppet / chef)
- Use the cloud (i.e. OpenStack, AWS, etc)
- *Planning to implement this next year*

Plans
-----

- Continue to build more content *(and tweak it)*
- Include outside speakers from the industry
- Include contributions from external sources

  - Because, FOSS!
- Develop new curriculum in EECS program

  - Create a side track focused on DevOps
- Expand beyond OSU to other Universities
